        Fun fact: CUSEC was founded by students and remains completely
        student-run. Since 2002, university and college students from all across
        Canada have come together to plan and organize this incredible
        conference. Every year, a new generation of passionate student
        volunteers dedicates time and energy to bring CUSEC to life — from
        recruiting speakers and sponsors, to designing workshops, coordinating
        logistics, and building a welcoming environment for attendees. Their
        commitment ensures that CUSEC stays true to its roots: a student-led
        initiative built by peers, for peers. Decades in, we continue to grow
        stronger, welcoming hundreds of delegates, industry partners, guest
        speakers, and contributing to a vibrant Canadian technology community.
