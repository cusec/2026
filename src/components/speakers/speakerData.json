      "talkTitle": "Winning in a Tough Tech Market",
      "talkDescription": "The technical interview process is more competitive than ever. Having navigated it myself this year, I've seen firsthand just how intense the market has become—and how success often hinges on more than just solving coding problems. At the same time, as someone who has interviewed and coached countless candidates, I know exactly what differentiates those who walk away with offers from those who don't.\n\nThis session is the most holistic, end-to-end guide to technical interviews you'll ever attend. We'll cover the entire journey: from building your network and preparing before the first recruiter call, to standing out during behavioral, coding, and system design rounds, to handling rejections, multiple offers, and negotiations with confidence. Along the way, I'll share concrete strategies, templates, and stories—drawn from both sides of the table—that reveal the little things strong candidates do differently to stand out.\n\nYou'll leave not just with a roadmap for interview prep, but with the practical tools and confidence to navigate every stage of the process—and maximize your chances of landing the offer.",

      "talkTitle": "Email Authentication Under Fire: Vulnerabilities and How to Mitigate Them",
      "talkDescription": "Created more than 40 years ago, the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), the foundational protocol for email communication, was designed without cybersecurity considerations. It lacked mechanisms to authenticate email senders, ensure confidentiality, or protect messages in transit. As a result, it became vulnerable to threats such as spoofing, email replay attacks, unauthorized message modifications, etc. Over time, initiatives such as SPF, DKIM, DMARC, S/MIME and BIMI were introduced to address these security gaps. However, inconsistent adoption has left most internet domains vulnerable to security risks, enabling cybercriminals to exploit them for phishing, spoofing, spam campaigns, etc. With major providers like Google, Yahoo and Microsoft requiring the implementation of authentication protocols and PCI DSS making them mandatory this year, the adoption of email security protocols is no longer optional. This talk will explore vulnerabilities in the email authentication protocols, how attackers exploit them, and practical steps organizations can take to strengthen email security, enhance domain reputation, and ensure reliable email delivery and compliance.",
